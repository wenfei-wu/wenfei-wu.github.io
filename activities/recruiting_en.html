Our research group focuses on the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Computer Network Architecture: Performance Optimization, Management Optimization</li>
<!---
<li>Cybersecurity: Security Protocol Design, Malware Detection</li>
--->
<li>Distributed System: Big Data, AI Systems.</li>
</ul>
Our research combines industrial experience, practical requirements and the CS
theoretical foundation, and aims to deliver solid information infrastructure systems. Our recent work "ATP: In-network Aggregation for Multi-tenant Learning" got the NSDI'21 best paper award (first time in China!). Group members also get good opportunities in the academia and industry (refer to the alumni in the homepage).
<br><br>
Now we are recruiting graduate students, postdoctoral students, and interns.
Mastering one of the following skills is required:
<ul>
<li>Solid mathematical/algorithmic foundation</li>
<li>Mastering at least one language in Linux environment</li>
<li>Being familiar with one or more areas  in CS, e.g., computer networks,
  distributed systems, operating systems, cryptography, artificial intelligence.</li>
</ul>
The following skills are a plus:
<ul>
