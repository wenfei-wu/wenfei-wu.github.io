<h3>Bio</h3>
Wenfei Wu is an assistant professor at Tsinghua University, and he would join Peking University Computer Science Department. Dr. Wu got his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015, and his research interest is in networked systems. Dr. Wu has published 33 papers, and some of them are in top conferences, including NSDI, INFOCOM, SIGKDD, etc. His Ph.D. work virtual network diagnosis was awarded the best student paper in SoCC'13. His work on 5G transport layer design was also awarded the best paper runner-up in IPCCC'19. 
And his work on programmable switch accelerated machine learning systems got the best paper award in NSDI'21.


<h3>Title</h3>
ATP: In-Network Aggregation for Multi-Tenant Training

<h3>Abstract</h3>
In Deep Neural Network (DNN), the size of the model and dataset is increasing, and the DNN training tends to be implemented in a distributed architecture. The PS-worker architecture for DNN systems suffers from the traffic incast problem, where many workers exchange traffic with the PS, causing the PS to be the bottleneck. Inspired by the recent progress in programmable switches, we propose an Aggregation Transmission Protocol (ATP), which supports multi-tenant and multi-rack in-network aggregation for DNN training. ATP consists of the networking stack on end hosts and the aggregation service on switches. The switch allocates its computation resources to jobs in a decentralized manner. The end host networking stack has a fallback to complement the switch's corner-case incapability(e.g., overflow, packet loss) and congestion control to share network resources. Finally, we made a bunch of engineering optimizations to make ATP saturate the high-bandwidth network (100Gbps). We wrap up ATP as a primitive in the transport layer and integrate it with ML systems, and show that ATP can provide both performance gain and correctness to typical DNN training (e.g., AlexNet, VGG, ResNet).
